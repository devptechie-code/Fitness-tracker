## When to Apply

This Skill should be used when the task involves **UI structure, visual design decisions, interaction patterns, or user experience quality control**.

### Primary Use Cases

This Skill is most useful in the following situations:

- Designing new pages (Landing Page, Dashboard, Admin, SaaS, Mobile App)
- Creating or refactoring UI components (buttons, modals, forms, tables, charts, etc.)
- Choosing color schemes, typography systems, spacing standards, or layout systems
- Reviewing UI code for user experience, accessibility, or visual consistency
- Implementing navigation structures, animations, or responsive behavior
- Making product-level design decisions (style, information hierarchy, brand expression)
- Improving perceived quality, clarity, or usability of interfaces

### Recommended

This Skill is recommended in the following situations:

- UI looks "not professional enough" but the reason is unclear
- Receiving feedback on usability or experience
- Pre-launch UI quality optimization
- Aligning cross-platform design (Web / iOS / Android)
- Building design systems or reusable component libraries

### Skip

This Skill is not needed in the following situations:

- Pure backend logic development
- Only involving API or database design
- Performance optimization unrelated to the interface
- Infrastructure or DevOps work
- Non-visual scripts or automation tasks

**Decision criteria**: If the task will change how a feature **looks, feels, moves, or is interacted with**, this Skill should be used.

## Rule Categories by Priority

*For human/AI reference: follow priority 1→10 to decide which rule category to focus on first; use `--domain <Domain>` to query details when needed. Scripts do not read this table.*

| Priority | Category | Impact | Domain | Key Checks (Must Have) | Anti-Patterns (Avoid) |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Accessibility | CRITICAL | `ux` | Contrast 4.5:1, Alt text, Keyboard nav, Aria-labels | Removing focus rings, Icon-only buttons without labels |
| 2 | Touch & Interaction | CRITICAL | `ux` | Min size 44×44px, 8px+ spacing, Loading feedback | Reliance on hover only, Instant state changes (0ms) |
| 3 | Performance | HIGH | `ux` | WebP/AVIF, Lazy loading, Reserve space (CLS &lt; 0.1) | Layout thrashing, Cumulative Layout Shift |
| 4 | Style Selection | HIGH | `style`, `product` | Match product type, Consistency, SVG icons (no emoji) | Mixing flat & skeuomorphic randomly, Emoji as icons |
| 5 | Layout & Responsive | HIGH | `ux` | Mobile-first breakpoints, Viewport meta, No horizontal scroll | Horizontal scroll, Fixed px container widths, Disable zoom |
| 6 | Typography & Color | MEDIUM | `typography`, `color` | Base 16px, Line-height 1.5, Semantic color tokens | Text &lt; 12px body, Gray-on-gray, Raw hex in components |
| 7 | Animation | MEDIUM | `ux` | Duration 150–300ms, Motion conveys meaning, Spatial continuity | Decorative-only animation, Animating width/height, No reduced-motion |
| 8 | Forms & Feedback | MEDIUM | `ux` | Visible labels, Error near field, Helper text, Progressive disclosure | Placeholder-only label, Errors only at top, Overwhelm upfront |
| 9 | Navigation Patterns | HIGH | `ux` | Predictable back, Bottom nav ≤5, Deep linking | Overloaded nav, Broken back behavior, No deep links |
| 10 | Charts & Data | LOW | `chart` | Legends, Tooltips, Accessible colors | Relying on color alone to convey meaning |

## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Analyze User Requirements
Extract key information from user request:
- **Product type**: Entertainment (social, video, music, gaming), Tool (scanner, editor, converter), Productivity (task manager, notes, calendar), or hybrid
- **Target audience**: C-end consumer users; consider age group, usage context
- **Style keywords**: playful, vibrant, minimal, dark mode, content-first, immersive
- **Stack**: React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, SwiftUI, Flutter, React Native, etc.

### Step 2: Generate Design System (REQUIRED)

Always start with `--design-system` to get comprehensive recommendations:

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<product_type> <industry> <keywords>" --design-system [-p "Project Name"]
```

### Step 3: Supplement with Detailed Searches (as needed)

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --domain <domain> [-n <max_results>]
```

### Step 4: Stack Guidelines

Get implementation-specific best practices:

```bash
python3 skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --stack <your-stack>
```
